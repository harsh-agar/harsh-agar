Let me tell you a bit about myself <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1520808873/3643/cool-doge.gif?1520808873" width="20" />

* 🖥️ I'm a Master's Student at Saarland University, majoring in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence.
* 🧑‍💼 Working part time with Bosch GmbH on Advanced Driver Assistance using Deep Learning for RADAR sensors.
* 🖨️ Earlier, I worked for two years with Bosch India, developing AI algorithms for next generation Camera and RADAR sensors.
* 🏠 Currently I live in Saarbrücken, Germany. 
* 🤯 A strange fact about me: I love to write complete sentences and over-explain myself, especially in unnecessary situations!
